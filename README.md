# Ada Cafe App

This code is for a workshop I ran at Flatiron School in London in celebration of Ada Lovelace Day.

It is a beginners intro to app development in React Native workshop.

## What we made:

A react native app for the Ada Cafe that let users see the list of coffees we had to offer, their price and a beautiful illustrative image.

The purpose of this app for the Ada Cafe would be to let their customers easily order their coffee on the phone.

Clicking a coffee gave visible feedback, like pressing a button. The actual implementation of ordering was left as an exercise to the reader.
